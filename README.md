In light of COVID-19, we have made an electronic version of the popular party game Beer Pong. Our Social Distance Beer Pong video game enables the user to throw a 40 mm diameter ball into infrared sensor-enabled cups, while the system’s microcontroller communicates via USB standard protocol with a C++ app that runs on the terminal of the user’s operating system to display the score. It’s like Guitar Hero, but for Beer Pong!
